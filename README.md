# EarthQuakeWatcher

The app gets the data from: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

The earthquakes are shown by markers on Google Maps. Only the earthquakes which are bigger than 2.5 magnitude are shown. 
If a markes is clicked more information can be seen on a popup. At the top of the screen "Show List?" button shows a 
list of the earthquakes which are clickable.
